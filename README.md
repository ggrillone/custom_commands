custom_commands
===============

Contains custom commands to be run from the terminal. Have only been tested in the mac os x terminal

These files should be moved to: `/usr/local/bin/` and must be set as executable: `chmod +x <file_name>`

##gcheckout
This command I made because I'm lazy and was tired of writing out entire branch names when switching branches.
This command will output all branch names for the current repository then you just need to enter the number
corresponding to the branch name and it will switch to that branch.
